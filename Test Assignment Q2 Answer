To be honest I'm not super familiar with the concept of machine learning and computer vision programs such as OpenCV, but
This is a quick summary on what I found based on articles and videos online such as:

For an application that is able to recognize the value and suit of the card that appears on video I would need to:

1) Get images of each card at different angles, lightnings, distances, orientation
2) In context of C# and .Net use Accord.NET for computer vision and AI
3) Convert image to greyscale to allow better detection due to there being less information to process
4) Use edge detection
5) Use some form of machine learning model like ML.NET to load and transform data
6) Train model to use the data
7) Implement software

For a more detailed answer I would definitely need more time to study this subject more in depth, but for now at least I understand the general idea of what is done and how.
